# BitcoinUnlimitedClassic
1 April 2017

We are proud to announce `BitcoinUnlimitedClassic`

The target of this [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) project is to restore logical `assert` to BitcoinUnlimited project, and to impose the limit of the block size to 2^20 bytes:
* we prefer `software crash` against`undefined behavior`;
* 2^20 bytes, are bigger than 1000000 bytes and lesser than unlimited.

thanks supporting, the BitcoinUnlimitedClassic team
